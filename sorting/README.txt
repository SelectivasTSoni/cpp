// README.txt

The files sorting.cpp, sorting_lib.cpp, sorting_lib.h are incomplete.


Note:
Compiling and linking are separare steps. Each .cpp file must be compiled before it can be linked. To produce the executable, we can use the command;

	g++ file1.cpp file2.cpp ... fileN.cpp -o program_name 

This compiles the .cpp files and links to produce the complete executable `program_name`
